<h1>Hi, I'm Bruce!</h1>

 
I‚Äôm a cybersecurity student passionate about helping organizations strengthen their digital defenses and adapt to an ever-changing threat landscape. My ultimate goal is to become a Cybersecurity Consultant, guiding businesses‚Äîespecially in the U.S. and Japan‚Äîtoward secure, resilient operations.

While pursuing my studies, I currently work as a server at Rodizio Grill & Windows Lab Administrator. These roles have helped me refine my interpersonal communication, situational awareness, and problem-solving skills‚Äîall of which are critical when working with clients and managing cybersecurity risks.

I‚Äôm actively developing technical expertise in areas such as threat intelligence, risk management, and network security. I‚Äôm especially interested in aligning cybersecurity strategies with business objectives to ensure both protection and performance.

Let‚Äôs connect and collaborate on creating secure solutions for the future!
